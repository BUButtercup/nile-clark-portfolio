                <p >I am a junior full-stack developer seeking an exciting new position where continuous learning is encouraged, and I'll be working with a dynamic, engaged, and supportive team to either create new projects or revamp existing ones.</p>
                <p> I am pivoting from a 15-year career as a nurse to seek a role where I can employ both logic and creativity to solve problems for the user. I love efficiency and innovation. My background in nursing helped me to develop my ability to work with a team, organize projects, and apply critical thinking to solve problems, but I am happy to be jumping into a field where I can use logic in conjunction with creativity!</p>
